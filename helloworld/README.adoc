== The Application
The `src/main` folder contains a simple 'Hello world' style Java application using a servlet and a CDI bean.

== Deploying the Quickstart
Make sure you have done all the link:../RUNNING_ON_OPENSHIFT.adoc#_prerequisites[prerequisites] and link:../RUNNING_ON_OPENSHIFT.adoc#_selectingcreating_a_project[selected/created a project].

Then install the Helm chart contained under `charts/helm.yaml` to install the applcation into OpenShift.
[source,shell]
----
helm install helloworld -f charts/helm.yaml jboss-eap/eap74
----
See the link:../RUNNING_ON_OPENSHIFT.adoc#_deploying_with_helm[Deploying with Helm] section for information about when the application will be ready.

== Running the application

To see the output of the application, you can run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
curl https://$(oc get route helloworld --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
----
You should see the following output:
[source,shell]
----
<html><head><title>helloworld</title></head><body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body><small>This EAP application has successfully been deployed on OpenShift.</small></html>

== Explaining the application configuration

This application is extremely simple, so apart from the standard information in link:../RUNNING_ON_OPENSHIFT.adoc#_introduction_to_helm_charts[Introduction to Helm Charts], link:./charts/helm.yaml[./charts/helm.yaml] contains no additional information.
